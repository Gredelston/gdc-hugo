description: (or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love the Static Site Generator That I Didn't Build)
---

If you browse my Github profile, you'll find two or three embarrassing attempts at building a personal website. My first few drafts used Gatsby, a Node-based static site generator. After that I tried building a custom web server based on Go's httputil.

The problem with my bespoke server is that it takes a lot of time and the final product is slapdash. The problem with Gatsby is that I suck at Node.

Enter [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. It took me two hours, end-to-end, to get a website that doesn't suck. It's supported by Netlify, so I don't need to learn how to use cloud hosting services like AWS/GCP. AND IT WORKS.

Oy gevult. I'm over the moon. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I actually have a blog instead of a project. It's a nice feeling.
