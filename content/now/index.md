[Now pages](https://www.nownownow.com) are so hip right now. Here's what I'm up to. Last updated: **May 31, 2021**.

**Home:** My fianc√©e and I are moving to Superior, CO! We are very excited for our puppy to have a backyard.

**Work:** I work at Google as a software engineer, writing libraries used for testing the firmware of ChromeOS.

**Alphabet Workers Union:** Organizing with my fellow workers.

**Meditation:** Excited to sit with my sangha in-person again. Our May meditation was our first in-person in over a year, and it was incredibly restorative. I can't wait til June's.

**Dog:** In August 2020, Jill and I got a puppy named Omelet. She is a handful. Recently we're excited to be working on a long line with her, looking forward to hiking off-leash.
